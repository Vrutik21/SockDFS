# SockDFS
This project implements a distributed file system with three servers (Smain, Spdf, Stext) and a client (client24s) using socket programming. The system supports multiple client connections, enabling upload, download, and management of .c, .txt, and .pdf files across different servers seamlessly, with clients interacting only with the main server.
